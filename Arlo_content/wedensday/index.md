# The Couch Pee Victory

[back to main](/)

## Introduction

Well, well, well. Today was a bit different. I did something that made me quite pleased with myself. Yes, you read that right. I peed on the couch, and I'm not even sorry about it.

## The Build-Up
### 9:00 AM - The Usual Routine

The day started like any other. The humans gave me my usual breakfast of, you guessed it, carrots. I hopped around, did my bunny things, and then I saw itâ€”the couch. It looked so inviting, so... perfect.

### 10:00 AM - The Decision

I don't know what came over me. Maybe it was the monotony of the day, or maybe I just wanted to shake things up. Either way, I decided that today was the day. The couch was going to be my new territory.

## The Act
### 10:30 AM - The Climb

Getting up there was the easy part. A quick hop onto the coffee table, and then another onto the couch. I settled in, making myself comfortable. The humans were busy with their own stuff, not paying attention to me. Perfect.

### 10:35 AM - The Moment of Triumph

And then, I did it. I peed on the couch. It was glorious. The humans didn't notice at first, which made it even better. I felt a strange sense of satisfaction. This was my space now.

## The Aftermath
### 10:40 AM - The Discovery

It didn't take long for the humans to notice. The look on their faces was priceless. They were shocked, then annoyed. But me? I was just sitting there, looking as innocent as ever. Mission accomplished.

### 11:00 AM - The Cleanup

Of course, they had to clean it up. They grumbled and complained, but I didn't care. I had made my mark, literally. They tried to lecture me, but I just twitched my nose and pretended to listen. 

## Conclusion

So, there you have it. My little act of rebellion. Will I do it again? Who knows. But for now, I'm basking in the glory of my couch pee victory. Sometimes, it's the little things that make life interesting.

Grumpily yours,

**The Grumpy Bunny**
