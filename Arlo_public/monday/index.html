        <div><h1><b>Monday</b> or is it Tuesday??</h1><p><a href="/">back to main</a></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Ugh, where do I even start? Being a bunny isn't all fluffy tails and cute hops. Sometimes, it's downright annoying. Let me tell you about my day.</p><h2>Morning Blues 6:00 AM - The Sun is Too Bright</h2><p>Why does the sun have to rise so early? Can't a bunny get some decent sleep around here? I barely closed my eyes, and now it's already morning. Great, just great.</p><h3>7:00 AM - Breakfast Drama</h3><ol><li>Carrots again? Seriously?</li><li>Can't we have something different for a change?</li><li>Maybe some gourmet lettuce or a nice piece of fruit. But no, it's always carrots. Every. Single. Day.</li></ol><p><img src="../images/arlo9.jpg" alt="Arlwo"> </img></p><h2>Midday Madness 12:00 PM - <i>Annoying Humans</i></h2><p><b>Humans</b> think they're so cute when they try to pet me. Newsflash: I'm not in the mood. Keep your hands to yourself, or you might get a nip. You've been warned.</p><h3>2:00 PM - Nap Time? Not Really</h3><p>Just when I think I can catch a break, the neighbor's dog starts barking. Non-stop. How is a bunny supposed to nap with all that racket? It's like they do it on purpose.</p><h2>Evening Grumbles 6:00 PM - Dinner Disappointment</h2><p>Guess what's for dinner? More carrots. I'm starting to think this is some kind of cruel joke. A bunny can only take so much.</p><p><img src="../images/arlo6.jpg" alt="Arlo"> </img></p><h3>8:00 PM - Bedtime Woes</h3><p>Finally, it's time to sleep. But wait, the humans are watching TV, and it's loud. Really loud. I just want some peace and quiet. Is that too much to ask?</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>So there you have it, a day in the life of a grumpy bunny. It's not all it's cracked up to be. Maybe tomorrow will be better, but I won't hold my breath.</p><p><i>Grumpily yours,</i></p><p><b>The Grumpy Bunny</b></p></div>
